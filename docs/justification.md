The CityCare Healthcare System adopts a modular architecture. The system is organized into clearly defined frontend and backend modules based on user roles such as patients, clinicians, administrators, and lab technicians, using React and TypeScript on the frontend and NestJS with TypeScript on the backend. This structure enables clear separation of functionality, improves code organization, and allows different functional areas of the system to evolve independently while sharing common services and components.

This architectural choice was made after comparing modular architecture with monolithic and microservices approaches. Monolithic systems become difficult to maintain and scale as complexity grows, microservices bring about significant operational overhead and complexity that was suitable for the nature of the project, but modular architecture provides a balance whereby it supports parallel development, reduces merge conflicts and simplifies testing.

From a healthcare perspective, the modular approach supports essential requirements such as role-based access control, data isolation, and auditability. Security boundaries between modules ensure sensitive patient data is accessed only by authorized roles, while the architecture integrates smoothly with CI pipelines using GitHub Actions for automated builds and testing. Overall, the modular architecture offers a scalable, secure, and educationally valuable foundation that meets both academic objectives and real-world healthcare system expectations.
